# VITyarthi_Project
This is a simple Python program that helps you track your weekly savings based on the money you already have. The program is written in a beginner- friendly style using only two modules.
* NumPy
    * matplotlib.pyplot
Backend:
1. You enter:
      *Your name
      *Your savings target
      *Your starting money
      *Number of weeks
      *Weekly amounts:
         positive = INCOME
         negative = EXPENSE
2. The program calculates:
      *Remaining money after each week
      *Whether your remaining money goes above or below the savings target
      *First week when your savings drop below the target (if it happens)
3. The program then plots a graph:
      *Weekly net amount (income or expense)
      *Remaining money line
      *A horizontal savings target line
Require you to download:
pip install NumPy matplotlib
OUTPUT:
The program prints:
    *Remaining money after each week
    *Whether savings increased or decreased
    *Warning if savings drop below target
A graph window appears showing:
    *Weekly net amount
    *Remaining money trend
    *Savings target line
